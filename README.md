# Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of various data science projects developed using Python. Each project demonstrates practical applications of data science techniques and algorithms, including data cleaning, data visualization and statistical analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this project, we perform an in-depth analysis of a given dataset. The goal is to understand the dataâ€™s structure, detect patterns, identify outliers, and visualize the key characteristics.

### Key Features:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization using Matplotlib

## Data Visualization
This project focuses on building interactive data visualization

### Key Features:
- Creating interactive graphs
- Data filtering and modification

## Web Scraper for News Collection

### Key Features:
- **HTML Parsing**: Extracting content by parsing HTML documents using libraries like `BeautifulSoup`.
- **HTTP Requests**: Using `requests` to send HTTP requests and retrieve web pages.
- **Data Storage**: Storing scraped data in formats like CSV and JSON.
- **Handling Rate Limits**: Implementing techniques to avoid being blocked or rate-limited.
